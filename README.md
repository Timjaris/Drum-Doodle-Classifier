# Drum-Doodle-Classifier
Classifies doodles from a drum pad based on whether or not they match a song. 

How it works is that you put some .wav songs in a folder called "Songs", then record yourself 
drumming on a drum pad while listening to each one (these will be called 'doodles'), and put 
those files in a folder called "Doodles". Each doodle should start with the name of the 
corresponding song.
